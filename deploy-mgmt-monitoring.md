# Managing and monitoring the deployment
{: #powervs-automation-solution-monitoring}

For deployment process monitoring, IBM Cloud Schematics monitoring interfaces are used. The same interface is used to audit and capture all user actions and relevant security events.
{: shortdesc}

For more information, see [Getting started: {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-getting-started), [Monitoring Schematics services by using IBM Cloud Monitoring](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-monitoring-instances) and [Auditing events](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-at_events).

## Infrastructure and landscape management and monitoring after deployment
{: #powervs-automation-solution-landscape-post-deployment}

For monitoring and management of provisioned resources, VPC and PowerVS interfaces are used. The same interface is used to audit and capture all user actions and relevant security events.

For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC documentation](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc) and [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} PowerVS documentation](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-started).

## Lifecycle management
{: #powervs-automation-solution-lifecycle}

Lifecycle management with PowerVS workspace and VPC service provisioning by using deployable architectures is limited to initial landscape deployments. Landscape update is not supported and must be done manually.
